This is the repository for my ADHD Bullet Journal Assignment for COMP 3025

By defining the purpose of my application, I hope to make it clear that this app isn't an ordinary "Planner" app. As I said in my idea, I have ADHD myself, and with that comes a very unfortunate set of problems: Impulsivity, Disorganization, Poor time management, Problems focusing, Poor planning, and a VERY low tolerance of frustration. Alongside that, I'm very visual, and am prone to distraction which leads to disorganisation. 

For my project, I want a "low-effort" interface. That means something that seems intuitive from the start, and shouldn't require a tutorial. This is to combat frustrations and distractions. Being able to use the app instantly means being able to at least start reaping the benefits. Secondly I want to make the app visually rewarding and stimulating. This would entail customization for the user to make it more fun for them, along with positive feedback loops that reward and stimulate my feeble brain. Finally, I want to implement an aspect of photography into this. Visual reminders are important, and sometimes describing a task in as few words as possible can be difficult. Taking a picture of a problem, and saving it to the app, I think, will help mitigate this problem and work well as a visual reminder. 



Some concepts I'll need to make this app happen are database access for storing images and possibly transferring data between phones. Calendar/date systems that will sync to a user's locale. And finally, perhaps some level of login functionality to protect user's information. 



(For login protection, I'm thinking that should come second to the "low-effort" interface. By that I mean, users should be able to download and interact with the app immediately, while having the ability to password protect their account as an added option afterwards, instead of up-front demanding access. (It might draw people away))

Proof that the firebase database will at least upload data. (Still need to implement Reading by the program)
